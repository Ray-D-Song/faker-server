## Faker Server

Faker Server is a mock server based on Faker.js. It can be used to generate mock data for development and testing.

## Deploy

Currently supports npm command and Docker deployment.

First, you need a MongoDB database and obtain the connection string. We recommend using MongoDB Atlas, but you can also deploy it yourself.

MongoDB Atlas usage method can be found [here](https://github.com/ray-d-song/faker-server/blob/main/docs/en/mongodb-atlas.md).

### npm command

```bash
# Install
npm install -g faker-server
# Start
faker-server
```

The program will generate a configuration file `.env` in your `~/.faker-server` directory. You can modify the configuration and restart the service as needed.

```bash
# Server Port
PORT=3000

# Access /mock/* API
ACCESS_KEY=${uuid}

# If true, the server will allow public access to the /mock/* API
# /api/* will continue to require authentication
PUBLIC_ACCESS=false

# Access /api/* API
ADMIN_KEY=${uuid}

# MongoDB URL
MONGO_URL=mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017?authSource=admin
```

`ACCESS_KEY` and `ADMIN_KEY` are randomly generated when the service is first started. You can also modify them as needed.

`ACCESS_KEY` is used to access the mock service, and `ADMIN_KEY` is used to manage the interface in the page. They are not interchangeable.

`PUBLIC_ACCESS` is true, the mock interface will allow public access, and the `/api/*` interface for editing will still require authentication.

### Docker

ðŸš§ Under Construction

## Access Service

The mock service interface address is `/mock/*`, for example, if you add an interface `/mock/user/list`, you can access it through `http://localhost:3000/mock/user/list`.

When `PUBLIC_ACCESS` is set to false, accessing the interface requires the `Faker-Server-Key` request header, with a value of `ACCESS_KEY`.
